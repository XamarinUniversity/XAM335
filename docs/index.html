        <h2>Mobile application architecture - XAM335</h2>
<p>We're going to focus on how to properly architect your application to separate the <em>presentation</em> from the business logic and data that drives it. We'll be looking at three primary patterns which are popular in the mobile world: Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-Presenter (MVP), and Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM).</p>
<h3>Upon completion you will be able to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Embed native controls into Xamarin.Forms</li>
<li>Customize a renderer for an existing control</li>
<li>Create a renderer for a custom control</li>
<li>Send notifications between renderer and element</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="parts/part1.html">Exercise 1: Add a native control to a Xamarin.Forms layout</a>
<br>
<p>The primary goal of this lab is to embed a native control into Xamarin.Forms layout. Specifically, you'll add an Android Floating Action Button to a Xamarin.Forms grid. You'll start with an existing Xamarin.Forms solution with a minimal interface with no behavior defined in a shared project. You're going to use this project to create a Xamarin.Forms sketch app. You'll modify the code to replace a toolbar button with a native control when running on Android.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part2.html">Exercise 2: Extend an existing renderer</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you'll extend the provided label renderers to create a clickable &quot;hyperlink label&quot; that can launch the default browser when tapped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part3.html">Exercise 3: Create a custom control</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you'll define a custom control to create a drawing surface that can be consumed in your shared code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part4.html">Exercise 4: Create a renderer for a custom control</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you'll create the platform-specific renderers for the custom drawing surface created in the previous exercise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part5.html">Exercise 5: Send notifications to the renderer and the element</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you'll send notifications to and from the renderer and the shared code without tightly coupling the element and the renderer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
